Today, I will be showing you the setup process for the iOS platform.\nI'll be guiding you in the step by step process in how to install the app shortcut to your home screen and how to set up a new account.\nFirst, you will want to go to SmartViewMD.com. Next, you will see an icon at the top right corner of your screen with three lines. You'll click that, and select sign up.\nFrom there, we'll start off with how to add this application to your home screen.\nYou'll click the middle icon at the bottom of your screen and scroll down to see add to home screen. You'll will click that. You can name the application, whatever you would like. But today I'm going to stick with SmartViewMD.com and I'm going to click add at the top right corner and it was simply added to my home screen for Easy Access. Next, I'll be showing you how to sign up with a new account. You may have this newly added application on the home screen and I will be clicking sign up at the bottom right from there will type in our first name or last name and our email address. Next, you'll be prompted to enter a strong password with more than seven characters that consist of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special symbols such as punctuation. And once you've entered in each field, you click sign up.\xa0After setting up your account, you are then prompted to select which medical device you're using. The current choices are the continuous glucose monitor, the blood glucose meter, the peak flow meter, the blood pressure monitor and the fingertip pulse oximeter. After selecting at least one medical device, you may then scroll down to enter your date of birth, gender, weight, height, address, city, state, zip code, phone number. And you may then select your primary health care provider from the drop down menu. At the bottom of your screen, you have the option to upload a personal photo of yourself, if you would like, and then submit your profile. Whenever you have new readings on whichever device or devices you chose, you may then enter them into the next screen. After submitting your readings, you will then be directed to a page with a documented list of the readings you have submitted.\nI hope this tutorial was useful to you and thank you for using SmartViewMD.\nIn my next video, I will show you how a medical provider will receive and review patient readings for that week from our SmartViewMD app and seamlessly attach those reading into the patient\u2019s medical report (aka Electronic Health Record, or more commonly referred to as the medical office\u2019s EHR system).\xa0 Thank you and take care.",v1:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4cGgfXqKfM?rel=0",v2:""},2:{title:"SmartViewMD Notifications",sd:"Hi, my name is Dorizabelle, the Chief Marketing Officer of Belle IT.\nThis video is a follow up to my previous video on how to install the SmartViewMD app on your smartphone.

The reminder notification will include a message like this   \u201cHi, Please remember to enter your medical device readings daily in my.SmartViewMD.com app.  Thank you.\u201d\nWhen the patient clicks on the link in that message,  they will be redirected to the SmartViewMD app where they can log in and then enter their readings (as shown in my previous video.)\nIn my next video, I will show you how a medical provider will receive and review patient readings for that week from our SmartViewMD app and seamlessly attach those reading into the patient\u2019s medical report (aka Electronic Health Record, or more commonly referred to as the medical office\u2019s EHR system).

From there, the provider opens and reviews the data. This information may then be saved directly into the patient\u2019s chart by associating it. This info is now available to all providers who access the patient\u2019s chart simply by going to the images section of the patient\u2019s chart and viewing. That's it. Hopefully, you enjoyed that quick tour of how SmartViewMD can feed data reviewed by a medical provider directly into a medical provider's EHR system.\nIn my next video, I will introduce you to my colleague Leo Jusme.\xa0\xa0Leo will provide some additional insight on entering readings from several medical devices into the SmartViewMD app. In addition,\xa0\xa0Leo and I will show you how patients can use the SmartViewMD app from their computer.\nThank you and I look forward to seeing you in our next video.",v1:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/seK15PV98KQ",v2:""},4:{title:"Instructions to [Pair] & [Read] Bluetooth Blood Pressure Monitor with SmartViewMD [iOS/Apple]",sd:"With the SmartViewMD app, in combination with your blood pressure monitor, it's easy to record your blood pressure results and share them with your doctor from the comfort of your home.\nFor your blood pressure monitor, please ensure that you have installed the batteries if you haven't done so already.\nIf you haven't already done so, (from the SmartViewMD.com website) download (for iPhone using TestFlight) or login (for Android Chrome browser) through your smart phone.\nTo begin, open settings on your smartphone and make sure Bluetooth is turned on.\nOn your SmartPhone, please adjust Audio volume for audible instructions that will guile you through the process.\nTo make the most of this solution, you'll 1st need to pair your smartphone with your  blood pressure monitor device.\nNow, similar to how you may have paired other Bluetooth devices, you'll pair your smart device with your  blood pressure monitor.\nNote: You only need to Pair once (for each Blood Pressure monitor)\nNext, open the SmartViewMD app and login.\nIf this is your first time using the app, you'll be prompted to provide select medical devices.
